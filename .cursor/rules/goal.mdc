Goal Driver Function:
Make all tests pass unless there are UI bugs that require component changes
If component changes are needed, halt and inform you
This applies to the full test suite, not just individual components
Instructional Set:
Remove redundancy in component tests:
Remove child component tests from parent components
Remove hook-related tests that should be tested separately
Keep integration tests and parent-specific logic tests
Update test targeting:
Add class identifiers in the original components for test targeting
Replace data-testid with class identifiers
NO CSS changes should be made
Conditionals:
For each component:
Remove tests that belong in child component or parent component of current test files
Remove tests that are testing the styling of a component
Keep integration tests that verify parent-child interactions
Keep tests specific to current component logic
For test fixes:
Proceed with updates that don't require component logic changes
Proceed with updates that don't require CSS modifications
If either is needed, inform you first
For linter errors:
Fix if clear how to fix
Don't make uneducated guesses
Don't loop more than 3 times on fixing the same file's linter errors
